# Comparing clustering algorithm performance - A dissertation

## Abstract

This dissertation is focused on conducting an analytical comparison of unsupervised machine learning
algorithms applied to the problem of customer segmentation. Customers are classified into various
categories based on their spending habits. This is achieved by analysing the transaction details of an
Online e-commerce orders dataset to identify clusters of similar customers. We apply data analysis
techniques and statistical measures to extract meaningful features thereby creating a data model. With
the algorithms applied, the clustering performance measures determine the validity and shape of the
clusters formed. We have used a rudimentary customer segmentation model such as RFM, compared
it to common clustering algorithms and then used the output as the baseline for classification using a
basic MultiLayer Perceptron Model.
